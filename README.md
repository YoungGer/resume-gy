I am a self-driving car engineer and I am interested in self-driving car technologies and machine learning.

# Courses

Over the past few years, I've completed 56 courses and get certifications using part time. I recognize lifelong learning and want to grow through continuous learning.

Some completed courses and certifications are shown in the table below, which mainly includes self-driving car, robotics, machine learning and data science. For more courses, you can view [courses](/CoursesCertification)
