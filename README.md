I am a self-driving car engineer, interested in self-driving car technology and machine learning.

# Courses

Over the past few years, I've completed 45 courses and got certifications using my spare time. I recognize the importance of lifelong learning and want to achieve self-growth through continuous learning.

Some completed courses and certifications are shown in the table below, including self-driving car, robotics, machine learning, and data science. For more courses, you can view [courses](/CoursesCertification).
