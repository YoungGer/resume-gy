I am a self-driving car engineer and I am interested in self-driving car technologies and machine learning.

Over the past few years, I've completed a lot of courses using parttime. I recognize lifelong learning and want to grow through continuous learning.

# Machine Learning & Data Science Courses

There are mainly two parts to know me.

- [CoursesCertification](/CoursesCertification): I've got 43 course certifications and 2 specialization certifications, most of which is related to machine learning and data science.
- [CoursesProjects](/CoursesProjects): I've practiced lots of codes through course learning. There are some codes to show my work.
