# KAGGLE COMPETITION - GETTING STARTED

# This script file is intended to help you get started on the Kaggle platform, and to show you how to make a submission to the competition.


# Let's start by reading the data into R
# Make sure you have downloaded these files from the Kaggle website, and have navigated to the directory where you saved the files on your computer 

# We are adding in the argument stringsAsFactors=FALSE, since we have some text fields

Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "C")

setwd("Downloads/")

eBayTrain = read.csv("eBayiPadTrain.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

eBayTest = read.csv("eBayiPadTest.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# We will just create a simple logistic regression model, to predict Sold using Price:

SimpleMod = glm(sold ~ startprice, data=eBayTrain, family=binomial)

# And then make predictions on the test set:

PredTest = predict(SimpleMod, newdata=eBayTest, type="response")

# We can't compute the accuracy or AUC on the test set ourselves, since we don't have the dependent variable on the test set (you can compute it on the training set though!). 
# However, you can submit the file on Kaggle to see how well the model performs. You can make up to 5 submissions per day, so don't hesitate to just upload a solution to see how you did.

# Let's prepare a submission file for Kaggle (for more about this, see the "Evaluation" page on the competition site):

MySubmission = data.frame(UniqueID = eBayTest$UniqueID, Probability1 = PredTest)

write.csv(MySubmission, "SubmissionSimpleLog.csv", row.names=FALSE)

# You should upload the submission "SubmissionSimpleLog.csv" on the Kaggle website to use this as a submission to the competition

# This model was just designed to help you get started - to do well in the competition, you will need to build better models!
