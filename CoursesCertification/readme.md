I'm an active learner and have learned lots of MOOC courses.
My interest lies in `robotics`, `machine learning` and `data science` which can been seen from my courses certification. 

There are some courses which help me a lot:

Main Machine Learning Courses Certification:
- "Deep Learning Nano Degree" by Udacity
- "机器学习基石" by National Taiwan University
- "机器学习技法" by National Taiwan University
- "MachineLearning Specialization" by University of Washington
- "Mining Massive Datasets" by Stanford University
- "Scalable Machine Learning" by University of California Berkeley

Main Robotic  Courses Certification:
- "Self-Driving Cars Specialization" by University of Toronto
- "Self-Driving Car Engineer" by Udacity
- "Sensor Fusion" by Udacity
- "Robotics: Perception" by 	University of Pennsylvania

Main Data Science Courses Certification:
- "AnalyticsEdge" by MIT
- "Introction to Spark" by UC Berkeley
- "Scalable Machine Leaning" by UC Berkeley
- "R Data Science Specialization" by Johns Hopkins University
- "Data Analysis and Statistical Inference" by Duke University

At meantime, I've finished other courses.
